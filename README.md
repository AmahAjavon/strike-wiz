Strike-Wiz is a fun addition game made for children. The goal of the game is to use
the 9 digits in the purple box to match the number shown after rolling the dice. The
dice roll simulation only puts out a random number between 2 and 12 (same as rolling
  2 dices). The player who successfully make all the numbers in the purple box disappear
  wins and is officially a Strike-Wiz. Enjoy.
